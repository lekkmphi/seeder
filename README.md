# Seeder: Your Personal Project Manager

A foundational project manager for small teams — simple to run, and yours to
fork. Runs on **Cloudflare Workers** (D1 + R2) or a single **Node VM**, built
with Next.js, Drizzle ORM, Better Auth, and Tailwind.

📖 **Full documentation: [seederpm.xyz/docs](https://seederpm.xyz/docs)**

## Philosophy

Project tools tend toward two extremes: the heavyweight complexity of Jira, or
lightweight boards small teams outgrow in a month. Seeder takes the opposite
stance:

- **Foundational, not heavy.** The essentials a small team needs to run
  projects, client requests, and day-to-day execution — productive immediately.
- **Yours to fork.** It's open source. Customization is a change to your own
  copy — add the field, view, or workflow you need without waiting on a roadmap,
  a plan upgrade, or any lock-in.
- **A small core, on purpose.** Keep the core minimal and solid; the rest is
  yours to build on.

## Features

- **Projects & Kanban** — tasks with categories, multi-tag labels, phases,
  priorities, assignees, due dates, and per-project code numbers.
- **Client requests** — a separate inbound queue (new → reviewed → converted →
  closed) that converts into tasks.
- **Public client board** — an opt-in, token-gated read-only view to share
  progress with clients without giving them an account.
- **Daily planner** — an adhoc/project daily task queue with drag-to-reorder.
- **Rich text & comments** — TipTap-powered descriptions, notes, and comments
  (Markdown-aware) with images and tables.
- **Activity feed** — every change is logged with before→after diffs, whether it
  comes from the UI or an AI assistant.
- **Roles, invites & notifications** — owner/admin/member roles, invite-only
  onboarding with a first-owner bootstrap, and in-app notifications.
- **White-labeling** — customizable system name, logo, favicon, and accent color.
- **Built-in MCP server** — let AI assistants read and edit your data over the
  Model Context Protocol ([docs](https://seederpm.xyz/docs/mcp)).

## Vietnamese localization

This fork ships with a Vietnamese-first interface:

- **Default language:** Vietnamese (`vi`), with English (`en`) fallback strings
  kept in place where the UI supports switching locales.
- **Localized areas:** dashboard, projects, Kanban/task modals, requests, daily
  planner, activity/history views, members/spaces, admin screens, settings,
  client board, comments, rich-text editor controls, toasts, tooltips,
  accessibility labels, empty states, and error/not-found pages.
- **Locale plumbing:** client components use `useLocale()` and server components
  use `getRequestLocale()` so labels, relative-time text, dates, aria labels, and
  action feedback can follow the selected locale.
- **Language control:** the app includes a language toggle and stores the current
  choice in the `seeder-locale` cookie.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run setup   # interactive wizard: dev / production (node) / production (cloudflare)
npm run dev     # local dev — Miniflare simulates D1 + R2, no Cloudflare account
```

`npm run setup` generates the env + config (and, for the node target, the
PM2/systemd/Docker + reverse-proxy artifacts). On first run, create the owner
account at `/sign-in` — sign-up is permitted only for the configured
`OWNER_EMAIL` and only while the instance has no users; after that, onboarding is
invite-only.

Prefer to wire it up by hand? See the
[manual setup](https://seederpm.xyz/docs/getting-started/manual-setup) guide.

## MCP server

Seeder ships a built-in [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
server at **`/api/mcp`**, so AI assistants can read and edit your projects,
tasks, requests, comments, and settings — it deploys with the app, so every
instance gets it for free. Mint a token at **Settings → API tokens** (read, or
read & write), then point your client at `https://<your-domain>/api/mcp` with the
token as a `Bearer` header. A token can never do more than the user who created
it, and every change shows in the Activity feed. Full tool list and setup:
[seederpm.xyz/docs/mcp](https://seederpm.xyz/docs/mcp).

## Forks in the wild

Seeder is yours to fork — and people do. Community variants built on top of it:

- **[goutou](https://github.com/jhfnetboy/goutou)** by [@jhfnetboy](https://github.com/jhfnetboy) — a Seeder variant that adds multi-repo Claude Code coordination skills (狗头军师): a "commander" dispatches work to a central board and per-repo "soldiers" pick it up over the MCP bus.

Built your own variant? [Open an issue](https://github.com/lekkmphi/seeder/issues) or a PR adding it here.
